## Logical Segmentation

### Layer 3

#### IPV4

2^32 space, logically divided into classes and public and private networks. IP addresses are expressed in dot delimited notation with 4 "quartets" with values from 0 to 255.

| Class | Valid Network Numbers |
|-------|---------------|
| A | 1.0.0.0 to 126.0.0.0 |
| B | 128.0.0.0 - 191.255.0.0 |
| C | 192.0.0.0 -223.255.255.0 |


#### IPV6

2^128 space.


### Layer 2

<!-- Switches create networks. Routers connect networks. -->

#### VLANs


## Loop Prevention <a title="Maybe redundancy should come first since it created looping problem." href="#"><sup>1</sup></a>




### STP

Switches are, in essence, repeaters. They resent received frames out all of their ports.



## Redundancy


## Security

### Authentication
